        <h2> Chloropleth Map of world exports (2000 - 2020)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> The Following Choropleth map identifies the total exports for the countries of the world 
        from 2000 to 2020 per $1 Billion USD. The colour scale was adjusted to logarithms in order 
        to eliminate large players such as China to better identify and compare the amount a country is exporting.

            <div class="pure-u-1-3">  
                <p> This bubble chart helps us identify some interesting patterns. Notably Europe exporting
                     slightly more relative to other regions when adjusting for population. Another pattern we 
                     have distinguished is exports forms a larger proportion of GDP in European countries compared 
                     to other regions. Such as Africa having lower exports and thus exports being only a smaller 
                     percentage of GDP, we could hypothesise that countries which are more developed tend to export 
                     more and therefore this forms a higher percent of GDP. Some countries are highlighted such as 
                     Luxembourg for have the highest percentage of export and Sudan for having the lowest 
                     percentage of GDP.

            <div class="pure-u-1-3">  
                <p> As we have identified in both Visualisation above China is the leading country for exports. 
                    The plot to the left identifies Chinese Exports from 1960 to 2020, the total Exports has been
                     log scaled in order to better visualize dips and changes year to year. We are able to 
                     hypothesise that this large dips or increase would be around key events which would have 
                     affected global markets changing the demand or supply of Chinese Exports.

                <h3> Chinese Exports by Industry </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 12;"> Now that we have identified the timeline of Chinese Exports we are able to look into the 
                    industry or sectors which China Exports the most. As seen from both Bar and Pie Chart Machines
                     from the large Majority of Chinese Exports at 47% and $1.25 Trillion USD, this is an 
                     unrivalled amount and any changes in the machining industry which would affect demand or
                      supply would have a major impact on the Chinese Exports industry and economy.
